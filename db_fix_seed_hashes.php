/**
 * ONE-TIME seed-hash fix.
 *
 * Re-syncs the canonical seed-user (admin / eng_faculty / poly_faculty /
 * pharm_faculty) password hashes to match the published passwords
 * (Admin@123 / Faculty@123).
 *
 * Gated by DB_SETUP_TOKEN so it can't be hit accidentally.
 *
 * Why this exists: when sql/seed.ready.sql is imported onto a fresh
 * managed database, the bcrypt hashes from the seed file may not match
 * what `password_verify('Faculty@123', $hash)` expects — usually because
 * the hashes were generated on a different PHP build with slightly
 * different algorithm params, or because the seed file predates a
 * password format change.
 *
 * After this runs, the seed users log in with the documented passwords.
 *
 * Usage: GET /db_fix_seed_hashes.php?t=<your DB_SETUP_TOKEN>
 *
 * Delete from repo after success: `git rm db_fix_seed_hashes.php`.
